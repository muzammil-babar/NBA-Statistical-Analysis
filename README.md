# NBA-Statistical-Analysis

This project was submitted during our group project for the hackathon which was part of our Quantitative Finance course at Politecnico di Milano Graduate School of Management.
We decided to understand the statistics and physical characteristics of former NBA players and analyzed if there were any correlations between some of the features that we chose. We then analyzed current NBA players and measured if there was a chance if any current players could become Hall of Famers.

The analysis included the use of Excel and R programming language. We employed the use of both supervised and unsupervised learning. Logistic and Linear Regression, along with PCA and clustering were used.
